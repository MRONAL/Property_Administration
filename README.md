# Propierties Managment

_This property management project aims to manage various aspects related to real estate properties. It uses a MySQL database that efficiently manages multiple components such as users, roles, property types, payments, and statuses. The entities are organized and related between the tables, which allows for effective and structured management of information._

## Starting 🚀

_The database engine used is MySQL 9.0.1, an improved and efficient version of the popular RDBMS. This version offers improvements in performance, query optimization and security, ideal for managing large volumes of data in web applications and enterprise systems._

### Pre-requisites 📋

_As a first instance, a command is needed to create a container and make the connection to the database with the tool you want to use._

```
docker pull mysql:latest
```

```
docker run -d --name c_mysql_propierty -e MYSQL_ROOT_ -p 3306:3306 mysql
```
